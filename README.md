This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using raw pointers with vectors in Rust.  The code attempts to modify a vector using a raw pointer after the vector's internal storage is possibly reallocated, resulting in undefined behavior. The solution shows how to avoid this by using safe Rust techniques and avoiding direct manipulation of the vector's internal data using raw pointers unless absolutely necessary and you are very experienced.
